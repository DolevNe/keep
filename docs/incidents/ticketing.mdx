## Overview

## Features

- Create tickets directly from incidents in the Keep UI
- Pre-populated forms with incident information
- Support for multiple ticketing providers
- Automatic ticket tracking and status updates

### Link Existing Tickets
- Link existing tickets to incidents
- Support for all configured ticketing providers
- Manual ticket ID and URL input
- Automatic incident enrichment with ticket information

## Supported Ticketing Providers

Keep supports the following ticketing systems:

- **Jira Cloud** - Issue tracking and project management
- **Jira On-Premise** - Self-hosted Jira instances  
- **ServiceNow** - IT service management platform
- **Linear** - Issue tracking for software teams
- **YouTrack** - JetBrains issue tracking
- **Redmine** - Open-source project management
- **Zendesk** - Customer service platform
- **Asana** - Project management and task tracking

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

To enable ticketing features, you must configure the following environment variable:

```bash
# Enable ticketing features in the frontend
KEEP_TICKETING_ENABLED=true
```

<Info>
The `KEEP_TICKETING_ENABLED` environment variable controls the frontend ticketing features, including the ability to create and link tickets from the Keep UI. This variable must be set to `true` to enable the ticketing buttons and modals in the incident interface.
</Info>

### Provider Configuration

Each ticketing provider requires specific configuration. See the [provider documentation](/providers/overview) for detailed setup instructions for each supported ticketing system.

**Important**: When configuring ticketing providers, you must specify the **ticket creation URL** in the provider's authentication settings. This URL is required for the "Create Ticket" functionality to work properly. The ticket creation URL should point to the page where new tickets can be created in your ticketing system.

For example:
- **Jira**: `https://your-instance.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue.jspa`
- **ServiceNow**: `https://your-instance.service-now.com/now/sow/record/incident/-1`
- **Linear**: `https://linear.app/your-team/issue/new`
- **Zendesk**: `https://your-company.zendesk.com/agent/filters/new`

Without this URL configured, the ticket creation feature will not be available in the Keep UI.

## Using Ticketing Features

### Creating New Tickets

1. Navigate to an incident in the Keep UI
2. Look for the "Create Ticket" button in the incident actions
3. Click the button to open the ticket creation modal
4. Select the appropriate ticketing provider (if multiple are configured)
5. Review and modify the pre-populated information:
   - **Title**: Incident name (auto-populated)
   - **Description**: Incident summary and details (auto-populated)
   - **Priority**: Mapped from incident severity
   - **Service/Component**: Affected services
6. Add any additional information specific to your ticketing system
7. Submit to create the ticket

<Info>
The ticket creation form is automatically pre-populated with incident information, including the incident name, summary, severity, and affected services. You can modify any of these fields before creating the ticket.
</Info>

### Linking Existing Tickets

1. Navigate to an incident in the Keep UI
2. Click the "Link Ticket" button in the incident actions
3. Select the appropriate ticketing provider (if multiple are configured)
4. Enter the ticket information:

   - **Ticket URL** (required): The full URL to the ticket (e.g., `https://company.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123`)
5. Submit to link the ticket to the incident

<Info>
When linking tickets, the ticket URL is required and should be the full URL to the ticket in your ticketing system. The ticket ID is optional but recommended for better tracking and integration.
</Info>
